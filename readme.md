The chunk_pc file is a loadable part of the world. It is what is needed for a physical chunk of the world. This includes the level geometry, level collision, sidewalk data, traffic splines, world objects, textures, etc. I say etc, but it really is probably just the tip of the iceberg. This is a massive monolithic file full of all kinds of things.
